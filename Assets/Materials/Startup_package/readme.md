**Project registration**
To register the project, use the appropriate template located in the "registration" folder, and send that to me. 

**Deadline:**
The registration should be sent as early as possible, and preferably 2 weeks before the project start

**Project plan**
The projectplan_template.docx contains a template project plan. It is written with a master thesis project in mind. The project plan should contain, as minimum:
* A short project description
* Timetables
* 3-4 Learning objectives
Some students prefer to also create a risk management plan, or a GANTT chart, and that is perfectly fine. There should only be items in the project plan that adds value to your project.

**Deadline**
The project plan needs to be handed in, 1 month after the project start

**Learning objectives**
To write the learning objectives, there are some guides in the learning_objective folder. 

Keep in mind when writing learning objectives, you describe what you can "do", once the project is finished. It is not deadlines or deliverables.

**Meeting structure**
You should create an online document (something I can access with a link), where you write meeting minutes and a summary of the work. The document should be updated the day before the supervisor meeting.

For each meeting, the document should contain
* Summary of work carried out, what we did this week:
* Presentation of results (figures, tables, code etc):
* Action points and goals for next week:

Write the document in such a way that all information that you would like to discuss is there. The report should also be written such that the material can assist in writing the final version of the master thesis.

**Thesis**
You are strongly recommended to create the thesis document from day one, and update it on regular basis, preferably before each supervisor meeting.

**Literature Survey**
During the first few weeks of the thesis period, you should conduct a literature survey and write a literature review. Here are some good sources for that:
